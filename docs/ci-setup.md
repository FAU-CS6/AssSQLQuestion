# CI and Docker builds

To ensure quality of the code this project is tested automatically at every push.
While the [GitLab CI YAML file](code/gitlab-ci.yml) holds the configuration of
the CI for this reason, the tests are not executed directly at the main repository.
Take a look at the [Mirror repository](docs/mirror-repository.md) wiki page for
further information on the location of the tests.

## CI

The CI consists of two main components: The tests of the PHP code and the tests
of the Javascript code.

### PHP tests

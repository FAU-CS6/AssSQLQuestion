## Mirror repository

Unfortunately it the main place of this code - the internal GitLab installation
of the Chair of Computer Science 6 - does not support GitLab Runners and the
GitLab CI and CD procedure. Because of that the main repository is mirrored to
a [second GitLab instance](https://gitlab.tab-e.de/qpi-sql/qpi-sql)
with GitLab Runners installed. All badges used here are based on the CI of the
mirror repository.

To enable all visitors of the main repository to retrace the results of the CI,
there is a guest account to be used at the mirror repository:

|Username|Password|
|:-:|:-:|
|cs6|thyqyrNE5kgQYHEx|

This user does not have any rights than viewing the code and the results of the
CI and CD. So fell free to take a look.
